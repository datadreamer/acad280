      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>Journal Project Proposal</i> (3%):<br/>
          Put together a 5 minute presentation on your journal project concept. Cover your data type, recording mechanisms, and initial ideas for representation and interface.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>DataViz Research</i> (3%):<br/>
          Put together a 5 minute presentation on the data visualization project assigned to you. Research the author, the subject being visualized, and the technology and techniques being utilized to implement it.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Social Media Service Research</i> (3%):<br/>
          Put together a 5 minute presentation on a social media service/application of your choosing (no facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat, or youtube).<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Physical Computing Project Research</i> (3%):<br/>
          Put together a 5 minute presentation on the physical computing project assigned to you.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Sensor Research</i> (3%):<br/>
          Put together a 5 minute presentation on the sensor type assigned to you (light, sound, proximity, temperature, vibration, orientation, radio, resistance, etc).<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Actuator Research</i> (3%):<br/>
          Put together a 5 minute presentation on the actuator type assigned to you (lights, speakers, motors, heaters, switches, shape memory alloys, etc).<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Interactive Environment Proposal</i> (10%):<br/>
          Working in a group, develop a proposal for an interactive installation for the lobby of the  new Iovine Young Hall. Using projectors, lights, cameras, sensors, and information systems, design an interactive environment that will engage people with the space and with each other. The experience should accommodate students of the Academy as well as outside visitors. Your proposal should include mockups of the appearance and functionality of the installation, a breakdown of the technological requirements, and a budget estimate.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Journal Project</i> (25%):<br/>
          Begin recording regular activity about your life. Your records should be happening at least once a day, but the more frequent they are the more interesting your results will be. Your journal should not be a blog, instagram account, or series of tweets… think outside the box! Your journal must provide a visual interface to your content that allows users to navigate it in an interesting way.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Internet of Things Project</i> (25%):<br/>
          Working in a group, develop a project based around concepts of telepresence, product design, service design and interaction design. Utilize web based storage of data, Arduino microcontrollers for controlling physical components, and front-end visualization techniques to interface with the physical components where necessary. Write a one page paper about your contribution to the project as well as your team member’s contributions.<br/>
          <br/>
        </li>
